#' Simulated Birth Data
#'
#' A dataset containing simulated birth data for examples with bdlim. Add outcome and covariate data is simulated. The exposure data is real exposure data. Therefore, it has realistic correlation structure. The exposures are consistent with the date of conception variables.
